### About Me
Before becoming a programmer and before I started my cybersecurity degree, I was in aviation for a little over 10 years. I started my first major career in the US Army, and it was there that I discovered I really loved learning about tech. Since then, I have studied very broadly in this enormous industry. However, my passion lies in programming and cybersecurity. With these tools and skills, I can build and I can defend!
    
I am a father of four awesome kiddoes. I have been married over a decade. My hobbies span wide, but when I am not spending time with family, you can generally find me playing some sort of game, increasing my skills in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, pounding heavy weights in the gym, or making some sort of nerdy D&D or gaming related tool/program.
